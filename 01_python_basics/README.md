01 · Python Basics — Meeting a New Language
===========================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Every meaningful conversation begins with introductions. Python basics give you the first words and gestures so you can relate to the language. Instead of memorizing syntax, imagine meeting a thoughtful friend. You learn their cadence, their favourite phrases, and the rhythm of their thoughts. Basics let you greet Python with curiosity rather than intimidation.

Human Analogy
-------------
Think of this as learning to say “hello,” “thank you,” and “tell me more” in a language that will help you map your ideas. When you travel to a new place, mastery isn’t required for connection—intentional presence is. Python basics are those first shared smiles.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- You will see how to communicate through print statements, comments, and simple expressions.
- We approach Python as a conversation partner: listen (read the code), respond (write your own lines), notice how it replies.
- The examples include small expressions and mindful pacing, so every line has a reason for being.

Bridging Note
-------------
From the root philosophy we now step into expressive basics. Next, in `02_data_types`, we explore the textures of information this language can hold—like learning the personalities of new friends.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. Where in your life do you feel the delight of first introductions? How might that energy guide how you meet Python?
2. After running the examples, what part of the conversation felt most natural? Which line invited your curiosity?
3. What tiny ritual can you create before each coding session to remind yourself this is a meeting, not a test?

Creative Task
-------------
Write a short script that prints a welcome message to your future self, acknowledging why you chose to learn Python in the first place.
