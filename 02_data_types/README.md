02 · Data Types — Meeting the Personalities of Information
===========================================================

Why This Exists
---------------
After greeting Python, we begin to notice the textures of the data it holds. Data types are like personalities: some are numerical and grounded, others are expressive like strings, while booleans offer crisp yes/no clarity. Understanding who you are speaking with helps you choose the right words and expectations.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine hosting a dinner where each guest has a distinct way of communicating. Numbers prefer structure; strings tell stories; lists love gathering pieces together. Seeing their differences is the first step toward harmonious conversation.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Explore integers, floats, strings, booleans, and the idea of mutability.
- Notice how each type responds differently to the same invitation (e.g., addition).
- Feel how declaring types is less about rules and more about honoring their nature.

Bridging Note
-------------
Coming from `01_python_basics`, you already trust that Python will respond kindly. Here you learn what form those responses can take. Next, in `03_input_output`, we practice meaningful exchanges—listening as well as speaking with these personalities.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. Which data type feels most like you today, and why?
2. When have you adapted your communication style to honor someone else’s nature? How might that help you choose the right type in code?
3. What emotions arise when you realize information can take many shapes?

Creative Task
-------------
Create a short script that stores three aspects of your personality using different data types. Print them in a way that feels like a gentle self-portrait.
