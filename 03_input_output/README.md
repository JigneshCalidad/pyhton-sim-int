03 · Input & Output — Creating a Caring Dialogue
===============================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Communication thrives on reciprocity. Input and output let you listen as much as you speak. Rather than launching commands into silence, you invite the user (even future you) into conversation. This two-way exchange reinforces that code can be empathic.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine sitting with a friend who asks, “How are you feeling?” and waits for your answer. Input is the question; output is the space you offer to share. Coding becomes relational instead of transactional.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Learn how `input()` gathers thoughts from someone at the keyboard.
- Observe how formatted `print()` statements can respond with clarity and warmth.
- Begin to sense how data types and input intertwine—what arrives as a string can be shaped into numbers or booleans.

Bridging Note
-------------
After honoring data types in `02_data_types`, you now practice inviting them into dialogue. Next, `04_operators` will show how these responses can interact, compare, and transform—like deepening a conversation with thoughtful questions.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. When do you feel most heard by someone else? How can your programs mirror that attentiveness?
2. How does pausing for input change your relationship to the code you write?
3. Imagine Python asking you a question. What would you want it to understand about you before it responded?

Creative Task
-------------
Write a script that asks you about your emotional weather today and replies with a gentle affirmation shaped by your answer.
