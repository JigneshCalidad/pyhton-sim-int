04 · Operators — Exploring Relationships Between Ideas
======================================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Operators help ideas interact. They allow numbers, strings, and booleans to connect, compare, and transform. When you use an operator, you are asking, “How do these pieces relate?” Understanding this brings emotional clarity to logic; you see not just the items in your world but also the dynamics between them.

Human Analogy
-------------
Consider the way you weigh choices: comparing options, combining insights, or noticing differences. Operators are like the internal questions you ask when deciding how elements of your life align.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Learn arithmetic operators as tools for balance.
- Discover comparison operators as reflections on truth.
- Experience logical operators as invitations to align conditions with intention.

Bridging Note
-------------
Having invited input in `03_input_output`, you now explore how those answers can interact with each other. Next, `05_flow_control` will show how these relationships influence the path your program chooses, similar to following intuition through decision trees.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. When you compare two choices in life, what inner operator do you use—addition, subtraction, or something else?
2. Which logical operator (`and`, `or`, `not`) mirrors how you set personal boundaries?
3. How does understanding relationships between values deepen your trust in Python?

Creative Task
-------------
Write a script that compares two intentions you have for the week and prints which one needs more of your energy right now.
