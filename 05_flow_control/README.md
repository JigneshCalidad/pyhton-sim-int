05 · Flow Control — Trusting Intuitive Pathways
===============================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Flow control allows your program to follow different paths depending on context. Much like your intuition guides decisions based on subtle cues, `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements help Python respond compassionately to different situations.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine checking in with yourself before accepting an invitation. You weigh energy, desire, and commitments. Flow control gives your code that same capacity for discernment.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Meet conditional statements as compassionate decision points.
- Learn how nested conditions offer nuanced responses.
- See how combining conditions honors multiple truths at once.

Bridging Note
-------------
Operators in `04_operators` showed you how values relate. Now you let those relationships influence direction. Next, `06_loops` will revisit these choices repeatedly, much like daily rituals that evolve through repetition.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. When you face a decision, what inner questions guide you? How would they look as `if` statements?
2. How can flow control honor both your needs and the needs of others?
3. Where in life do you notice multiple truths existing at once?

Creative Task
-------------
Write a script that checks your current energy level and suggests whether you should study, rest, or reach out to someone—using compassionate conditional logic.
