06 · Loops — Honoring Rhythms and Rituals
=======================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Loops let actions repeat with intention. They mirror your personal rituals: morning tea, evening reflection, weekly check-ins. Instead of rewriting similar instructions, you create a compassionate rhythm that sustains progress without exhaustion.

Human Analogy
-------------
Think of watering plants. You do it consistently, adjusting to each plant’s needs. Loops give your code that same attentive, cyclical caring.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Experience `for` loops as mindful lists you walk through.
- Use `while` loops to stay present with a condition until it changes.
- Learn when to pause or break a loop, honoring boundaries even in repetition.

Bridging Note
-------------
After making decisions with `05_flow_control`, loops allow those decisions to guide repeated actions. Next, `07_functions` will gather these rituals into reusable offerings—like creating a meditation you can revisit whenever needed.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. What daily ritual of yours feels most like a loop? How does it support you?
2. How can loops prevent burnout by automating tasks while preserving meaning?
3. When is it compassionate to break a loop—in code or in life?

Creative Task
-------------
Design a loop that lists small joys you want to remember each morning. Let it print one sentence that makes you smile.
