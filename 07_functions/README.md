07 · Functions — Crafting Reusable Care Rituals
==============================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Functions gather intentions into reusable offerings. Instead of rewriting the same thoughtful steps, you create a named ritual that can be called whenever needed. This mirrors how you design personal practices that center you.

Human Analogy
-------------
Think about brewing tea. You have a process: boil water, steep leaves, pour mindfully. A function captures that sequence so you can share it or repeat it with ease.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Learn to define functions with `def`, giving them meaningful names.
- Offer parameters to personalize each ritual.
- Return values that feel like insights you can tuck away for later.

Bridging Note
-------------
From loops in `06_loops`, you sensed the power of repeated actions. Functions elevate those actions into intentional tools. Next, `08_strings` will show how functions can weave language and stories together.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. What supportive ritual in your life could become a function? What would you name it?
2. How does wrapping logic into a function create emotional space in your code?
3. When you reuse a function, what does it feel like to trust your past self?

Creative Task
-------------
Write a function that returns a sentence affirming why you are learning Python today. Call it for different moods.
