08 · Strings — Weaving Words into Meaning
=========================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Strings are how Python carries stories, reminders, and expressive notes. They give voice to the logic you build, allowing empathy and clarity to coexist with structure. Mastering strings means learning to craft messages that resonate.

Human Analogy
-------------
Consider writing in your journal. You choose words carefully, shaping your inner landscape into sentences that keep you company. Strings are those sentences inside your program.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Explore creating and combining strings with intention.
- Learn how formatting can highlight what matters most.
- Practice slicing and methods to reshape language without losing soul.

Bridging Note
-------------
Functions in `07_functions` gave you tools to package rituals. Strings let those rituals speak gracefully. Next, `09_lists` will help you gather multiple strings (and other types) into curated collections.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. What words comfort you when you feel uncertain? How can strings hold them?
2. How does formatting a message change the feeling it carries?
3. When do you notice the power of rephrasing—either in conversations or code?

Creative Task
-------------
Compose a script that builds a short mantra using string concatenation and formatting. Let it read like a message from your wisest self.
