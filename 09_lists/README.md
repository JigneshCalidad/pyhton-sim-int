09 · Lists — Curating Collections of Meaning
============================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Lists gather related pieces so you can explore them together. They function like playlists, journal entries, or a collection of memories. Understanding lists teaches you how to curate, reorder, and revisit the elements that matter.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine a shelf of favorite books. Each title is distinct, yet the collection tells a story about who you are. Lists give Python that same storytelling power.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Create lists that hold different data types together.
- Add, remove, and slice elements like rearranging cherished notes.
- Iterate through lists to appreciate each item’s presence.

Bridging Note
-------------
After weaving individual strings in `08_strings`, lists help you gather those strings—and any other types—into meaningful sets. Next, `10_oop_fundamentals` will show how you can shape custom containers for even richer stories.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. What collections in your life (books, memories, songs) feel like lists? How do you care for them?
2. How does adding or removing items from a list mirror the way you edit your environment?
3. When does iterating over a list feel like journaling through your thoughts?

Creative Task
-------------
Create a list of moments you want to revisit this month. Write code that prints each with a sentence explaining why it matters.
