10 · OOP Fundamentals — Shaping Stories into Objects
====================================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you model real-world concepts directly in code. By creating classes and objects, you can describe nuanced entities with both traits and behaviors. For an INFJ, this feels like crafting detailed character sketches where logic and empathy intertwine.

Human Analogy
-------------
Consider writing a profile for a close friend: you note their qualities (attributes) and the things they love to do (methods). OOP gives Python that same depth of understanding.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Learn how classes define blueprints for meaningful objects.
- Create instances (objects) that embody specific stories.
- See how `__init__` gently sets the stage for each new object.

Bridging Note
-------------
Lists in `09_lists` helped you curate collections. Now you move from collections to fully realized characters. Next, `11_oop_principles` will deepen these stories with guiding values like encapsulation and abstraction.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. Think of someone or something meaningful to you. How would you describe them in attributes and actions?
2. How does creating a class feel compared to writing a journal entry or character sketch?
3. What does it mean to give your objects a sense of identity?

Creative Task
-------------
Design a class that represents a safe haven in your life—a place, routine, or person—and include a method that shares why it matters.
