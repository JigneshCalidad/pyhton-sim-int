11 · OOP Principles — Giving Structure to Compassionate Design
==============================================================

Why This Exists
---------------
OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and responsibility help your objects stay grounded. They ensure every part of your program knows what it cares for and what it can safely share. This supports clarity and keeps your narratives coherent.

Human Analogy
-------------
Think about how you maintain healthy boundaries. You share certain stories with certain people, keep some reflections private, and reveal complexity gradually. OOP principles mirror that emotional intelligence.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- See encapsulation as wrapping data and behavior together with care.
- Approach abstraction as revealing only what supports the moment.
- Consider responsibility (single responsibility principle) as a promise to keep your classes focused.

Bridging Note
-------------
After meeting objects in `10_oop_fundamentals`, you now refine how they interact. Next, `12_oop_methods` will explore the diverse ways objects can express themselves through different method types.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. When have boundaries protected your energy? How might classes need similar protection?
2. How does sharing only what’s necessary (abstraction) feel in your relationships?
3. Where could a class in your code be simplified to hold a single responsibility?

Creative Task
-------------
Sketch a class that keeps a list of comforting affirmations private, but offers a method to share one at a time when asked gently.
