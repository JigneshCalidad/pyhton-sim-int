12 · OOP Methods — Conversations Within a Class
===============================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Methods are how objects communicate—both with themselves and with the wider program. Understanding instance, class, and static methods helps you decide who should speak, what they should know, and how they should share. This invites harmony inside your classes.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine a close-knit team. Individual members have personal stories (instance methods), the group agrees on shared values (class methods), and sometimes wisdom comes from a universal truth (static methods).

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Practice creating instance methods that use each object's attributes.
- Explore class methods for shared history or configuration.
- Witness static methods offering supportive utilities.

Bridging Note
-------------
After defining guiding principles in `11_oop_principles`, you now give your objects distinct voices. Next, `13_oop_inheritance` will show how these voices can evolve across generations of related classes.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. When do you speak from personal experience versus group consensus?
2. How might your classes benefit from having both individual and shared methods?
3. What wisdom feels universal enough to live in a static method?

Creative Task
-------------
Design a class with one method that shares a personal story, one that speaks for the whole group, and one that offers timeless guidance.
