13 · OOP Inheritance — Honoring Lineage in Code
===============================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Inheritance allows new classes to grow from existing ones, inheriting traits while adding their own nuances. It reflects how we stand on the shoulders of those who came before, carrying forward wisdom and adding our unique voice.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine a family tradition. Each generation keeps the essence yet adapts it to their era. Inheritance gives your objects that same evolutionary grace.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Create a base class with foundational behavior.
- Derive subclasses that extend or refine those behaviors.
- Override methods thoughtfully to express individuality.

Bridging Note
-------------
After hearing methods speak in `12_oop_methods`, inheritance shows how those voices can harmonize across related classes. Next, `14_oop_polymorphism` will celebrate how different subclasses can respond uniquely to the same invitation.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. What traditions or values have you inherited, and how have you reshaped them?
2. How does seeing commonality between classes help you organize complex ideas?
3. When is it loving to override a tradition with a new approach?

Creative Task
-------------
Write a base class representing a meaningful ritual, then create two subclasses that adapt the ritual for different moods or seasons.
