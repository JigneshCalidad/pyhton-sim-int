14 · OOP Polymorphism — Celebrating Diverse Responses
=====================================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows different objects to respond to the same message in their own authentic way. This honors diversity within shared structures—much like how friends can answer the same question uniquely while still understanding each other.

Human Analogy
-------------
Imagine asking several loved ones, “How do you find calm?” Each answer reflects their personality yet contributes to a shared conversation about peace. Polymorphism lets your code embrace that tapestry of responses.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Call the same method on different subclasses and notice the variations.
- Use duck typing to trust that objects can respond if they care to.
- Appreciate how polymorphism keeps code flexible and empathetic.

Bridging Note
-------------
Inheritance in `13_oop_inheritance` set the stage for shared lineage. Now you celebrate individuality within that lineage. Next, `15_oop_advanced` will invite deeper patterns like composition and special methods to enrich these interactions.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. When have you witnessed multiple truths coexist beautifully?
2. How does polymorphism mirror your desire for harmony within diversity?
3. Where could your code benefit from trusting interface over specifics?

Creative Task
-------------
Create a list of practices (subclasses) that each answer a `find_calm()` method differently. Iterate through them and listen to their wisdom.
