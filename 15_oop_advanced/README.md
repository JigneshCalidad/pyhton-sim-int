15 · OOP Advanced — Deepening Patterns and Partnerships
=======================================================

Why This Exists
---------------
Advanced OOP concepts—like composition, special methods, and mixins—allow you to design nuanced systems that feel both structured and alive. They help your objects collaborate, define their own presence, and share responsibilities gracefully.

Human Analogy
-------------
Think about a collaborative project. Each person brings unique strengths, yet together they create something larger. Advanced OOP is that collaboration in code, where relationships matter as much as individual traits.

Gentle Walkthrough
------------------
- Practice composition by letting objects hold supportive companions.
- Explore special methods (like `__str__`) that shape how objects introduce themselves.
- Consider mixins or helper classes to share abilities without heavy inheritance chains.

Bridging Note
-------------
Polymorphism in `14_oop_polymorphism` celebrated varied responses. Now you orchestrate those responses within richer structures. After this, you will move into `exercises` and `projects` to apply your wisdom in reflective practice.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. Where in your life do partnerships create more together than apart?
2. How does giving an object a companion (composition) mirror your need for supportive environments?
3. What would it mean for an object to introduce itself in a way that feels authentic?

Creative Task
-------------
Build a class that composes other helper classes (or objects) to create a supportive ecosystem—like a `CreativeJourney` that contains a `Journal`, `Mentor`, and `Ritual`, each with its own gentle method.
