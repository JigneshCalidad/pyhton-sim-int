Exercises — Reflective Practice Invitations
===========================================

These exercises are journaling prompts disguised as code. Move through them slowly. Each script includes guidance inside comments so you can expand or adapt them to fit your story.

How to Use
----------
- Read the docstring to understand the emotional intention.
- Run the script, observe its questions, then add your own voice.
- Journal alongside the code. Let edits and reflections happen together.

Reflective Habit
----------------
After each exercise, ask yourself: *What did I learn about how I think?* Capture that in your journal so the insight stays personal.
