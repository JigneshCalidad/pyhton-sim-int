Projects — Bringing Meaningful Tools to Life
============================================

Each project circles a real-world practice: tracking moods, reflecting on books, nurturing habits, and tending a digital journal. Move slowly. Read the project README, explore the code, then adapt it so it mirrors your rhythms.

Suggested Flow
--------------
- Open the project folder.
- Read the README to understand the emotional goal.
- Run the Python script, observe the prompts, and personalize the details.
- Expand the project with features that would nourish you daily.

Remember: these are living companions, not assignments. Let them evolve with your insight.
