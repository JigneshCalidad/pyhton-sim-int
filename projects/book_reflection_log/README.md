Book Reflection Log — Conversations with Stories
================================================

Purpose
-------
This project helps you capture how books change you. Rather than logging pages read, you record insights, characters who stayed with you, and questions that linger.

How It Works
------------
- Enter book details and a meaningful reflection.
- The script stores entries and can export them to a simple text file for safekeeping.
- You receive a closing prompt to integrate the wisdom.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. Which book shifted your perspective recently? Why?
2. What themes resurface across different stories?
3. How do fictional journeys mirror your own inner quests?

Creative Extension
------------------
Customize the export format, or add tagging to group reflections by mood, theme, or season of life.
