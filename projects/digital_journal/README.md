Digital Journal — A Sanctuary of Words
======================================

Purpose
-------
This project invites you to keep a digital journal that feels as intimate as a handwritten one. Each entry captures mood, gratitude, and a reflection, saved to a file you can revisit.

How It Works
------------
- Enter your mood, gratitude, and an open reflection.
- The script timestamps the entry and saves it to a journal file.
- You can view recent entries to notice evolving patterns.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. How does capturing your inner world in code change how you see it?
2. Which part of the entry (mood, gratitude, reflection) feels most grounding?
3. What would make this journal feel even safer and more welcoming?

Creative Extension
------------------
Add password protection, tags, or mood-based prompts to personalize your sanctuary further.
