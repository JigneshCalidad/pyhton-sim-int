Habit Tracker — Visualizing Gentle Commitments
==============================================

Purpose
-------
Track habits that nourish you without turning them into rigid obligations. The goal is to visualize consistency as a supportive rhythm, not a scorecard.

How It Works
------------
- Define habits you want to observe.
- Log daily check-ins to note whether you honored each habit.
- View a simple textual visualization of your progress.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. Which habits feel restorative versus performative?
2. How does seeing your consistency written out affect your motivation?
3. What does your inner voice say when you miss a day?

Creative Extension
------------------
Modify the visualization or add reminders, such as gentle affirmations when a habit is completed.
