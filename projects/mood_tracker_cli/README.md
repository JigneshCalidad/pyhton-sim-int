Mood Tracker CLI — Listening to Your Emotional Weather
======================================================

Purpose
-------
This command-line companion invites you to record moods across days and notice emerging patterns with compassion. Instead of judging fluctuations, you will treat them as messages from your inner landscape.

How It Works
------------
- You enter the day, mood, and a short note.
- The script stores entries in memory during the session.
- It offers gentle summaries to help you see trends and prompts a reflection at the end.

Reflect & Connect
-----------------
1. What surprised you about your emotional weather this week?
2. Which moods feel like invitations rather than obstacles?
3. How can you respond to these patterns with more kindness?

Creative Extension
------------------
Adapt the script to save entries to a file or visualize mood frequencies. Imagine it as a trusted friend keeping track for you.
